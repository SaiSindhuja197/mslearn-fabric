# Exercise 1: Ingest data with a pipeline in Microsoft Fabric

### Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

In this exercise, you'll ingest data into a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse using pipelines and Apache Spark. Pipelines allow you to extract data from external sources and load it into OneLake. Spark enables you to transform the data at scale before storing it in lakehouse tables for analysis. Ensure data is successfully loaded into OneLake before applying transformations.

    ![Account-manager-start](./Images/lab1-image16.png)

## Task 5: Create a Notebook

In this task, you'll create a Notebook to document your data analysis. You'll set up the environment, import libraries, and structure your code for exploration, visualization, and insights.

1. From the left pane, select the workspace named **Fabric-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

    ![](./Images/E2-T4-S1.png) 

1. In the workspace, click on **+ New Item (1)**. In the New item panel, search for **notebook (2)** and select **Notebook (3)**.

    ![03](./Images/ex1t5p2.png)

    >**Note:** If **Enhance your notebook experience with AI tools** wizard opens, click **Skip tour**.

1. After a few seconds, a new notebook with a single cell opens. Each notebook consists of code or markdown cells used for running code or adding formatted text.

1. Click **Add data items (1)** drop-down under explorer and select **Existing data source (2)** from the drop-down.

    ![](./Images/E2-T4-S4.png) 
 
1. Select the previously created **Lakehouse_<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** then click **Continue (2)**.
 
    ![](./Images/ex1t5p5.png) 

1. Select the existing cell in the notebook, clear the default code, and replace it with the **variable declaration (1)** below. Then click **&#9655; Run (2)** to execute the cell.

    ```python
   table_name = "sales"
    ```

    > **Note:** If the Spark session doesn't start, try clicking on Run All button on the top menu, this should restart the Spark session.

   ![11](./Images/01/Pg3-Notebook-S2.png) 

1. In the **Ellipsis (...) (1)** menu for the cell (at its top-right) select **Toggle parameter cell (2)**. This configures the cell so that the variables declared in it are treated as parameters when running the notebook from a pipeline.

     ![Account-manager-start](./Images/Lake18.png)

1. Hover under the parameters cell, use the **+ Code** button to add a new code cell. 

     ![](./Images/E2-T4-S9.png) 

1. Add the following code to it:

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import *
    
    # Read the new sales data
    df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header","true").option("inferSchema","true").load("Files/new_data/*.csv")

    ## Add month and year columns
    df = df.withColumn("Year", year(col("OrderDate"))).withColumn("Month", month(col("OrderDate")))

    # Derive FirstName and LastName columns
    df = df.withColumn("FirstName", split(col("CustomerName"), " ").getItem(0)).withColumn("LastName", split(col("CustomerName"), " ").getItem(1))

    # Filter and reorder columns
    df = df["SalesOrderNumber", "SalesOrderLineNumber", "OrderDate", "Year", "Month", "FirstName", "LastName", "EmailAddress", "Item", "Quantity", "UnitPrice", "TaxAmount"]

    # Load the data into a managed table
    #Managed tables are tables for which both the schema metadata and the data files are managed by Fabric. The data files for the table are created in the Tables folder.
    df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable(table_name)
    ```

     ![](./Images/code1.png) 

    This code loads the data from the sales.csv file that was ingested by the **Copy Data** activity, applies some transformation logic, and saves the transformed data as a **managed table** - appending the data if the table already exists.

1. Verify that your notebooks look similar to this, and then use the **&#9655; Run all** button on the toolbar to run all of the cells it contains.

    ![Screenshot of a notebook with a parameters cell and code to transform data.](./Images/fab8.png)

    > **Note**: Since this is the first time you've run any Spark code in this session, the Spark pool must be started. This means that the first cell can take a minute or so to complete.

1. (Optional) You can also create **external tables** for which the schema metadata is defined in the metastore for the lakehouse, but the data files are stored in an external location.

    ```python
    df.write.format("delta").saveAsTable("external_sales", path="<abfs_path>/external_sales")

    #In the Lakehouse explorer pane, in the ... menu for the Files folder, select Copy ABFS path.

    #The ABFS path is the fully qualified path to the Files folder in the OneLake storage for your lakehouse - similar to this:

    #abfss://workspace@tenant-onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/lakehousename.Lakehouse/Files
    ```
    
    > **Note**: To run the above code, you need to replace the <abfs_path> with your abfs path

1. When the notebook run has completed, click on your  **Lakehouse** pane on the left, in the **Ellipsis (...)** menu for **Tables** select **Refresh** and verify that a **sales** table has been created.

    ![.](./Images/fab-6.png)

1. Navigate back to the **Notebook** on the left pane and use the ⚙️ **Settings (1)** icon at the top to view the notebook settings. Then, set the **Name** of the notebook to **Load Sales Notebook (2)** and close the settings pane.

     ![.](./Images/fab-7.png)
 
1. In the hub menu bar on the left, select your lakehouse.  

    ![03](./Images/ex1t5p14.png)

1. In the **Explorer** pane, refresh the **view (1)**. Then expand **Tables (2)**, and select the **sales (3)** table to see a preview of the data it contains.

    ![03](./Images/ex1t5p15.png)

## Task 6: Use SQL to query tables

In this task, you'll use SQL to query tables in a database. You'll write statements to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data, helping you analyze the dataset and build your SQL skills.

1. At the top-right of the Lakehouse page,  click on drop-down (1) and switch from **Lakehouse** to **SQL analytics endpoint (2)**. Then wait a short time until the SQL query endpoint for your lakehouse opens in a visual interface from which you can query its tables, as shown here:

    ![03](./Images/ex1t6p1.png)

1. Use the **New SQL query** button to open a new query editor, and enter the following SQL query:

    ![](./Images/E2-T5-S2.png)

    ```SQL
   SELECT Item, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS Revenue
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY Item
   ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
    ```

1. Use the **&#9655; Run** button to run the query and view the results, which should show the total revenue for each product.

    ![](./Images/E2-T5-S3.png)

## Task 7: Create a visual query

In this task, you'll create a visual query in Power BI using Power Query. Start by adding the Sales table to the query editor, select the necessary columns, and apply a Group By transformation to count distinct line items per sales order. Then, review the summarized results.

1. On the toolbar, under **New SQL query (1)** drop-down, select **New visual query (2)**.

    ![](./Images/Ware711.png)

1. In the Lakehouse, navigate to **Schemas**, then to **dbo**, expand the **tables** folder and select the **sales** table. In the sales table, click on **Elipsis &#8230; (1)** or **Right click** and select **Insert into canvas (2)**. It is in the new visual query editor pane that opens to create a Power Query. 

    ![](./Images/Lake21.png)

1. In the **Manage columns (1)** menu, select **Choose columns (2)**. Then select only the **SalesOrderNumber and SalesOrderLineNumber (3)** columns and click on **OK (4)**.

    ![Account-manager-start](./Images/lab1-image22.png)

    ![Account-manager-start](./Images/lab1-image23.png)

1. Click on **+ (1)**, in the **Transform table** menu, select **Group by (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of a Visual query with results.](./Images/Lake22.png)

1. Then group the data by using the following **Basic** settings.

    - Group by: **SalesOrderNumber (1)**
    - New column name: **LineItems (2)**
    - Operation: **Count distinct values (3)**
    - Column: **SalesOrderLineNumber (4)**
    - Click **OK (5)**

        ![](./Images/01/Pg3-VisQuery-S4.01.png)

1. When you're done, the results pane under the visual query shows the number of line items for each sales order.

    ![Screenshot of a Visual query with results.](./Images/E2-T6-S6.png)

## Task 8: Create a report

In this task, you'll create a report to visualize your data findings. You'll select relevant data, choose appropriate visuals, and organize the report to clearly present insights and support data-driven decisions.

1. At the top of the SQL analytics endpoint page, select the **Model Layouts** tab.
    
    ![](./Images/Lake23.png)

    >**Note:** You might notice some additional tables appeared as shown below, please ignore the system tables which are shown in ignore.

    ![Screenshot of a data model.](./Images/ig.png)

    > **Note**: In this exercise, the data model consists of a single table. In a real-world scenario, you would likely create multiple tables in your lakehouse, each of which would be included in the model. You could then define relationships between these tables in the model.

1. In the top menu bar, select the **Reporting** tab. Then select **New report**.

    ![](./Images/E2-T7-S2.png)
   
1. In the pop-up, click on **Continue** to add data to the default semantic model.

    ![](./Images/E2-T7-S3.png)

1. In the **Data** pane on the right, expand the **sales** table. Then select the following fields:

    - **Item (1)**

    - **Quantity (2)**

   Then, a **Table visualization (3)** is added to the report.

     ![Screenshot of a report containing a table.](./Images/E2-T7-S4.png)
   
1. Hide the **Data** and **Filters** panes to create more space if required. Then, make sure the **Table visualization is selected (1)** and in the **Visualizations** pane, change the visualization to a **Clustered bar chart (2)** and resize it as shown here.

      ![Screenshot of a report containing a clustered bar chart.](./Images/E2-T7-S5.png)

      ![Screenshot of a report containing a clustered bar chart.](./Images/E2-T7-S5a.png)

1. On the **File (1)** menu, select **Save As (2)**. Then, name the Report as **Item Sales Report (3)** and click **Save (4)** in the workspace you created previously.

      ![](./Images/Lake25.png)
   
      ![](./Images/Lake26.png)

1. In the hub menu bar on the left, select your workspace to verify that it contains the following items:
    - Your lakehouse.
    - The SQL endpoint for your lakehouse.
    - A default dataset for the tables in your lakehouse.
    - The **Item Sales Report** report.
