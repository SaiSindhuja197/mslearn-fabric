- **Data Engineering - Ingest Data in Fabric with Fabric Copilot**: Utilize Fabric Copilot and Dataflow Gen2 to create a data pipeline, leveraging natural language for data ingestion and transformation.
- **Data Warehouse - Analyze Data in a Warehouse with Fabric Copilot**: Analyze data in a warehouse by connecting to data sources, running queries, and visualizing insights using Fabric Copilot to enhance decision-making.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have the following prerequisites:

- **Basic understanding of data management and analytics**: Familiarity with data concepts and terminology will aid in navigating Microsoft Fabric's features.
- **Familiarity with Microsoft 365 tools**: Experience with common Microsoft 365 applications, such as Excel and Power BI, will be beneficial.
- **Azure subscription with appropriate permissions**: Access to an Azure account with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources within Microsoft Fabric is required.
- **Access to Microsoft Fabric**: Participants should have access to Microsoft Fabric with Copilot enabled to perform the exercises.
- **Knowledge of SQL and data visualization**: Understanding SQL queries and data visualization techniques will assist in executing the lab tasks effectively.

## Architechture

The architecture for the **Microsoft Fabric with Copilot** lab enables end-to-end data integration, analytics, and visualization workflows using Fabric's advanced tools and AI capabilities. It begins with creating a dedicated **workspace** to manage resources and collaborate effectively. **Data ingestion** is facilitated through **pipelines** and **Spark-powered** notebooks, storing data in a **Lakehouse** for analysis. Structured data is processed in a **data warehouse**, where **tables** and **data models** are created for efficient querying and reporting. **Fabric Copilot** enhances automation by enabling natural language interactions for data ingestion, transformation, and report generation. This streamlined architecture provides scalability, productivity, and actionable insights, supporting complex data engineering and analytics scenarios.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves several key components:

- **Microsoft Fabric**: A comprehensive data analytics platform that integrates tools for data engineering, analytics, and visualization, including AI-powered capabilities like Fabric Copilot.

- **Workspace**: A collaborative environment within Microsoft Fabric where resources, projects, and tools are managed, enabling efficient organization and teamwork.

- **Lakehouse**: A unified data storage architecture combining the benefits of data lakes and data warehouses, optimized for both raw and structured data.  

- **Pipeline**: A sequence of data processing steps used to implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) workflows to move and process data.  

- **Notebook**: An interactive tool in Fabric that allows users to write and execute Apache Spark code for data analysis and transformation at scale.  

- **SQL**: A programming language used to query, manipulate, and analyze data stored in tables within the Lakehouse or other data stores.  

- **Visual Query**: A graphical interface that enables users to design and execute data queries without writing code, making data exploration more accessible.

- **Report**: A structured presentation of data insights, often with visualizations like charts and graphs, created for stakeholders to analyze results.

- **Fabric Copilot**: An AI-driven assistant in Microsoft Fabric that helps automate tasks such as data ingestion, transformation, and reporting using natural language commands.

- **Dataflow Gen2**: A modernized data pipeline tool in Fabric that enables the creation of scalable and automated workflows for ingesting and transforming data.

- **Data Warehouse**: A centralized, structured repository optimized for querying and reporting, used for storing processed data ready for analysis.

- **Table**: A structured arrangement of data in rows and columns, used to organize and store information in databases or warehouses.  

- **Data Model**: A structured representation of data and its relationships, designed to enhance analytical queries and reporting efficiency.

**Fabric trial provides access to most features, but excludes Copilot, private links, and trusted workspace access ([learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/fabric-trial#overview-of-the-trial-capacity)).**
